              Nurturing health and wellness through virtual care. <br />
              At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic of the year 2020, when the
              idea of Sitibox Health速 was first conceived by our founder, Dr.
              Olanipekun Babatunde John, it was thought out as a novel idea that
              could bring quality and affordable virtual healthcare to the
              people of all ages and background around the world. Today, we are
              delivering on that novel idea by providing an efficient and
              affordable teleconsult service through the Sitibox Health App速.
